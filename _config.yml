# You can configure many Jekyll options, overriding defaults in this file.
# Possible options are here: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration

## IMPORTANT ##
# If, like me, you prefer tabs over spaces for indentation, polease be aware that using tabs in YAML
# files used by Jekyll breaks stuff. Don't do that. Single space only in YAML front matter.

# Set the markdown parsre to the less fragile Redcarpet
markdown: redcarpet
# Set the default URL structure for posts. See for details:
